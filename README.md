# Calibrated Precision

This repository provides python codes to reproduce the experimental results from paper **["Master your Metrics with Calibration" Wissam Siblini, Jordan Fréry, Liyun He-Guelton, Frédéric Oblé and Yi-Qing Wang (2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02827).** 

It includes the implementation of the calibrated precision as well as the calibrated f-score (in calibrated_metrics.py), the calibrated average precision (calibrated_metrics.py) and the calibrated precision-recall gain (prgc.py). It also includes a notebook that allows to reproduce all the results from the paper.
